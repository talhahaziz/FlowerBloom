# FlowerBloom
Using CSS I created a blooming flower - this project was me testing limits of CSS and putting what I learnt into practice!


If you want to try out this code - download the respository and files open in VSCode or your own compiler once files are placed into one folder you can open the html using
the a live server extension and see the flower bloom for yourself!
